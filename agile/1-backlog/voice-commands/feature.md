# Feature: Voice Commands

**Created:** 2025-12-12
**Owner:** Michael
**Discovery Phase:** not_started

## Description

Parse voice transcriptions as commands and execute actions. This enables hands-free control of applications and workflows - opening apps, clicking, typing, navigating, and automating multi-step workflows.

This feature builds on `ai-transcription` and represents the full vision of voice-controlled desktop interaction.

### Context from ai-transcription Discovery

**User Persona**: Power user who wants to navigate multiple applications, input data, and execute workflows using voice instead of keyboard and mouse.

**Problem**: Navigating multiple applications and inputting data with keyboard and mouse is slow. Users want voice control to speed up workflows and reduce friction.

**Potential scope considerations**:
- Command parsing (keyword-based vs AI-interpreted)
- Supported actions (app launching, typing, clicking, window management)
- System permissions for accessibility/automation
- Custom command definitions
- Safety mechanisms (confirmation for destructive actions)
