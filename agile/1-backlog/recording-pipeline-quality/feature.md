# Feature: Recording Pipeline Quality

**Created:** 2025-12-23
**Owner:** Michael
**Discovery Phase:** not_started

## Description

[What should be built and why - provide context for the team]

## BDD Scenarios

### User Persona
A general user who wants reliable, good-quality audio recordings without needing technical expertise. They expect the app to "just work" and produce clear audio output.

### Problem Statement
Users experience both audio quality issues (noise, distortion, low fidelity) and reliability problems (recordings that drop, stutter, or fail unexpectedly). This foundation work must be addressed before adding other features that depend on reliable audio capture and processing.
